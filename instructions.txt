FILES DESCRIPTION:
- odomTf: includes transformation broadcast from odom frame to base_footprint frame

TF TREE STRUCTURE:
map -> odom -> base_footprint 	-> laser_front
				-> laser_rear

BAGS USAGE:
Map has been created with the second bag, while the localization process has been tested with the third and the first bag

MAP CREATION:
Map has been created without any custom node, but by using gmapping

HOW TO START:
- Mapping: start mapping.launch (package name project_2)
- Localization: start localization.launch

OTHER INFOS:
- When both launch flies are launched, a RVIZ window is opened, in order to track the results; from here it is possible to save the view with the command File -> Save image (image saving service)
- Parameters that influenced the most on map and localization quality: particles (gampping), laser alpha values (amcl)
